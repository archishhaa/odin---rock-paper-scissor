## Overview

This project is a simple implementation of the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows a human player to compete against the computer in a visually appealing interface. Players can make their choice by clicking buttons, and the game keeps track of scores, announcing the winner after a series of rounds.
